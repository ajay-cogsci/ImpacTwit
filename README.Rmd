impacTwit is a twitter text mining tool.  It allows the search of multiple terms about the same topic and outputs a dataframe with tweet time, original tweeter, and the actual tweeter along with the number of followers.  This data can be used to create cumulative plots, cumulative plots by original tweeter and by source string.  Future goals include:

* Integration of the Altmetrics API
   * Twitter searches aren't archived, this would allow measuring the impact of    older papers
   
* Creation of Network diagrams and other advaced visualization

* Functions to calculate different network properties about the spread of a topic
